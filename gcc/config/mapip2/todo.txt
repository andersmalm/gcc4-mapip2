This list is not sorted.

* Direct syscalls.
* -fomit-frame-pointer on by default at -O2.	OR NOT
 * If you want to debug, pass -fno-omit-frame-pointer.
* Smaller constants (8, 16, and 24-bit).	ASSEMBLER ONLY.
* Relative jumps.	ASSEMBLER ONLY?
* Move the most-used non-8-bit immediates to non-writable registers, and change the instructions that use them. LINKER ONLY?
 * Assembler insns would have to be made relaxable, I think.
* Fix emit_move_insn bug.
* Fix builtin-bitops-1.c.
* Fix 930622-2.c.
* Fix longlong-to-float conversion.	DONE!
* Direct floating-point support.	DONE!
 * Let's have 16 64-bit registers.	DONE!
 * Allocate f8 for return values. DONE!
 * Save half of them. Allow parameter passing in the other half.	BUGGED!
  * Fix saving of f0 - f7.
* Register allocation order.
 * f8-f15, f0-f7, g0-g13, p0-p3, r0-r1, s0-s7, fr. (zr, ra, sp are fixed and may not be allocated by anything.)
* Fix jc zr.
* Copy testsuite here. We have a modification or two.
* Change CASE insn to store operands in .rodata section, for faster load?
